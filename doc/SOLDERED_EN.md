## 3. Assembly
Attach the rubber feet.
![](./img/IMG_8143.jpg)
Install the encoder cover, paying attention to the orientation.
![](./img/IMG_8145.jpg)
Place the switch plate.
![](./img/IMG_8148.jpg)
Install all switches starting from the four corners in order.
![](./img/IMG_8650.jpg)
Insert the switch pin vertically into the socket to prevent bending.
![](./img/IMG_8654.jpg)
Ensure the slide switch is turned off.
![](./img/IMG_1006.jpg)
Connect it to your PC using a USB cable and verify that each button functions properly.
![](./img/IMG_1015.jpg)
Insert the acrylic stand into the switch plate.
![](./img/IMG_8155.jpg)
Peel off the protective film from the acrylic plate.
![](./img/IMG_8159.jpg)
Attach the acrylic cover to the switch plate so that it sandwiches the acrylic stand and acrylic plate.
![](./img/IMG_8175.jpg)
Slide the acrylic plate into place with your finger while adjusting it for smooth and easy installation.
Insert the nut into the gap in the stem, then tighten the 5mm screw just enough to prevent the nut from falling out.

Tighten the screw onto the rotary encoder shaft until it cannot be removed.
![](./img/IMG_8661.jpg)
Peel off the protective sticker from the acrylic plate, insert it into the knob, and attach it to the stem.
![](./img/IMG_8724.jpg)
Position the screw head so that it fits into one of the notches.

## 5. Troubleshooting

- The key isn't responding.
Please check if the switch pins are bent. If they are bent, using tweezers or needle-nose pliers makes it easier to straighten them.

- The part has become loose.

Using masking tape or similar materials to enlarge the shaft or fastener may improve the situation. Adhesive bonding is also possible.

- The part broke/is missing.
