## Disassembly and Assembly

Thread the 8mm screw and 15mm screw onto the spring washer and washer in that order.

Pull off the knob cover. Be careful not to lose the small acrylic cap.

Remove the switch plate. While you can remove them all at once, for safety, remove each switch individually.

Remove all switches from the switch plate for installation.

Place the adapter and secure it in three places using 15mm screws and nuts.

Using a nut pusher makes it easier to tighten nuts in hard-to-reach places.

Place the switch plate over the switch and attach it from all four corners.

All switches were installed without bending the pins.
